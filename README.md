# Information

Recently Steam introduced an update to the trading scene which meant that you are required to have a smartphone in order to trade 
instantly using the Steam Guard application, and if you did not have this then you are fucked, and you'd have to wait 3 days for the trade 
to go through.

This application will act as a mobile authenticator, providing you with the Login (2FA) codes for each account and the ability 
to quickly confirm trades right on your desktop. Account information is protected by an individual password and the application 
can be used on multiple computers (providing you can move all the files between computers using a flash drive or something more neat, like Dropbox).

*Keep in mind that this is in BETA stage as of right now, and there are changes to come*

Project was inspired from when I saw [Jessecar96](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamDesktopAuthenticator/)'s version, although it was nowhere near complete and missed features that I wanted such as popup. Credits for the idea goes to him:
