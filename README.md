# Information

Recently Steam introduced an update to the trading scene which meant that you are required to have a smartphone in order to be able to trade items instantly using the Steam application, and if you do not have a smartphone connected then you will need to wait three days for the items to reach the one you're tradign with.

This application will act as your own mobile authenticator, providing you with the login (2FA) codes for each account and the ability to quiickly confirm trades and market transactions right on your desktop. All your accounts can be protected by a password if you see fit, and it can be easily ported around to multiple computers via USP or a cloud service such as Dropbox or Google Drive.
